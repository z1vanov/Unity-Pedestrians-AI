# Unity-Pedestrians-AI

This is the project i did for my major degree. Contains one scene of a city containing pedestrians and cars. The main theme of the project is "inteligent behavior of keeping distance". So the pedestrians are made to go around dangers and other pedestrians. Cars wait the pedestrians on crossroads. There is Evacuation event where can be seen the difference in the time of evacuation for different distance that pedestrians keep.

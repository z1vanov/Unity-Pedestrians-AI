# Unity-Pedestrians-AI

This is the project i did for my major degree. Contains one scene of a city with pedestrians and cars. The main theme of the project is "the inteligent behavior keeping distance". Pedestrians are made to go around dangers and other pedestrians. Cars wait the pedestrians on crossroads. There is Evacuation event where can be seen the difference in the time of evacuation for different distance that pedestrians keep.
